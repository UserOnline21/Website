            Noita's high replayability, fun wand editing and exploration gives alot to its score. But its high
            difficulty can be very tough on new players, especially with how unfair the game is. thus resulting in a 9
            out of 10.

            Abyssus is a fantastic game, its difficult but in that challenging way that pushes you to improve your
            skills and seek out upgrades. combine that with its exploration and customisation options and you get a
            10/10 game.

            Evil West is an amazing beat em up game with its charming wild west world, its story, gameplay and
            adjustable difficulty gives it a 10/10.
