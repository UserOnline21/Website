            <p>Noita is a roguelike game physics simulator where every pixel is simulated. this means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>everything can be destroyed down to a single pixel</li>
                <li>powders like sand and snow flow naturally</li>
                <li>every single pixel is trying to kill you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Noita is a very hard game, see below.</p>

            <p>
                the difficulty of the game is balanced by exploration and learning. each death teaches you something new
                to use in the next run.
            </p>
            <p>
                Noita is filled with mysteries to uncover. and while the game may break you, you are given the tools to
                break it back.
            </p>
            <p>
                the tools to break Noita come in the form of wands and spells, tinkering with your wand is an integral
                part of Noita. with something as simple as a homing rock being one of the most powerful spells in the
                game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Noita has more than just spells. It also has alchemy in the form of magical liquids and powders that
                react and change when mixed. dilute poison with water, transform solid steel into steam and make gold
                out of nothing!
            </p>
            <p>
                Noita above all else is a game that tests you with unrivalved challenge and adversary, with a world that
                extends into infinite possibilities, beating the game is akin to beating the tutorial as the world opens
                up to you as you learn what you are capable of. your wands and spells becoming so powerful that the
                biggest threat to your run is your own PC giving out on you. starting as a simple mage in Noita, you
                finally surpass the gods themselves.. and then a polymorph potion results in your death, i highly
                reccomend Noita to anyone that enjoys roguelikes, magic and brutally hard games that reward you for
                learning to exploit the system!
