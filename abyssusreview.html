                Abyssus is a roguelike first person shooter game, with upgrades to buy, weapons to find and secrets to
                discover. Abyssus is set in an abandoned underwater temple, stranded and forced to rely on a strange
                power to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
                the game is cut into three zones, each zone having unique enemies, an elite at the halfway point, and a
                boss at the end. defeating elite and boss enemies gives you soul orbs, allowing you to buy permanant
                upgrades.
            </p>
            <p>
                the weapon system in abyssus is incredible. each weapon has 2 parts that can be edited, each part has 3
                attachments to pick from. to unlock these attachments you must do challenges with the weapon equipped.
                there are also gadgets which are used for utility.
            </p>

            <p>
                Abyssus has many challenges to master, ranging from exploring the hub area for secrets to defeating the
                final boss in under 30 minutes. each challenge unlocks new charms, vanity items, weapon augments and
                gadgets, giving a high level of replayability.
