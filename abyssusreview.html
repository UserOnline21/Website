            Abyssus is a roguelike first person shooter game, with upgrades to buy, weapons to find and secrets to
            discover. Abyssus is set in an abandoned underwater temple, stranded and forced to rely on a strange power
            to survive.

            the game is cut into three zones, each zone having unique enemies, an elite at the halfway point, and a boss
            at the end. defeating elite and boss enemies gives you soul orbs, allowing you to buy permanant upgrades.
